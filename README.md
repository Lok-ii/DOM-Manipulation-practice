### Description: 

- The HTML file (Index.html) sets up a basic webpage with a <div> element having the id "container."
- The CSS styles in the "style.css" file define the appearance of this container, making it a 500x300px box with a cursive font and a grey border.
- The JavaScript code in "script.js" selects the container element and dynamically modifies its styles. It changes the background color to yellow, adds margin and padding, increases the font size, and makes the text bold. These changes are applied directly to the HTML element, demonstrating how JavaScript can manipulate the appearance of elements on the web page in real-time.
